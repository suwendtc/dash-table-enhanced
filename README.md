# dash-table-enhanced

1. Before import dash_table in your python files, make sure to add sys.path.insert(0, '${your_path}/dash_table_enhance/').
2. DON'T CHANGE name of the folder, dash_table, in dash_table_enhanced folder. dash_table will be referenced as a module name in other dash related packages. As long as folder name, dash_table, stays the same, you can place dash_table folder inside of any folder(s), just make sure you follow step 1 and update sys.path correctly.
3. No need to uninstall the original dash table, since step 1 will load modified dash_table module first.
